# Business Card OCR

I have given you a functional JAR file you can run it as

```java -jar card.jar "Your card text here" ```

it will output 
``` 

==>

Name: person name
Phone: Phone number
Email: person email

```

You will need en-ner-person.bin in the same dir as the jar file

If you want to compile this, you will need to add opennlp to your project, I downloaded it from
https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/opennlp/opennlp-1.9.3/apache-opennlp-1.9.3-src.zip
